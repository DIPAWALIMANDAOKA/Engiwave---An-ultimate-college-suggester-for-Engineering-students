Welcome to the College Suggester Website project! This web application aims to assist students in finding suitable colleges based on their MHTCET percentile, district, location, caste, and university preferences. The site utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest colleges and branches that match a user's criteria.

Features 
Suggestion Engine: Employs machine learning algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to provide personalized college recommendations.
User Authentication: Secure login system to manage user accounts and preferences.
Database Integration: SQL database to store user data and link it seamlessly with the frontend and backend.
Explore Branches: Detailed information about various academic branches offered by different colleges.
Popular Colleges: Ratings and feedback-based listing of top-rated colleges.
About Us: Details about the project, team, and objectives.
Feedback Section: Allows users to provide valuable feedback for improvements.
